Investors who believe the economy is growing can invest in stocks if a strong economy helps companies improve their earnings. For example, the MSCI index tracks stocks in the US and other developed and emerging markets, and the S & P 500 index, a global index of more than 2,000 stocks, measures the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPY), and a variety of other indices.

This is known as the bull market and occurs when the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S & P 500 (SPY) and Standard & Poor's 500 enter one of the longest bull markets in US history. The biggest one-day loss on the US stock market occurred on Monday, October 19, 1987, when it fell 508 points, or 22.6 percent. [Sources: 2, 3]

This huge decline was not followed by a recession, and share prices subsequently recovered to new highs. Many point to "Black Monday," as the day was called, as confirmation of stock market irrationality. This decline could be explained by major news events, as rising interest rates and a falling dollar began to weigh on the market, which had been temporarily overvalued during the five-year bull run.

For a certain amount of money, a share can be paid by someone who owns the shares in the form of cash, shares, bonds or other forms of investment. [Sources: 1]

The other way an investor can benefit from buying a stock is to sell it at a profit. An investor buys shares to raise money for the company's growth. If an investor buys a share of a company's stock at $10 a share, and the price of the stock subsequently rises to $15 a share, the investor will realize 50% return on his investment before selling his shares.

The Exchange shall designate an existing public market for the issue and sale of shares traded on an exchange outside the over-the-counter market. The stock exchange tracks the supply and demand of listed shares and determines whether its participants (investors and traders) are prepared to buy or sell. Investors can then buy and sell the shares themselves or trade on the stock exchange. [Sources: 1, 6]

An efficient stock market is seen as crucial to economic development, because it enables companies to raise capital quickly from the public. To build a diversified portfolio by buying a lot of individual shares, you can invest in a type of investment fund called an index fund or exchange traded fund.

These funds aim to passively reflect the performance of an index by holding all the shares in the investment index. The US market charts include the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S & P 500 and the Standard & Poor's 500.
