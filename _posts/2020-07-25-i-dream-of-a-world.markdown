I wonder of the distinct difference between a society that has been nurtured from a place of love, instead of a place of greed and fear. 

I wouldn’t call myself a cruel person, nor a person that is actively negative. However, as I look at my community; the people that I call my neighbors; the people that I look towards daily. It resonates in my heart that something is missing within all of us. 

Something.. has not been taught. Something.. hasn’t been understood. Individually, we live our lives and we try to actively improve ourselves and continue through life with the teaching that we must find our goal, our passion. 

But as I grow older, it’s dawned on me that these things shouldn’t be our goal to achieve, they should be nurtured within us while we are growing. You’re thinking.. well of course, It’s only natural to improve yourself. It’s how you excel forward. But why, I ask; must we excel forward over others? Instead of equally living our lives without the desire to be better than another.

I dream of a world where instead of an individual excelling forward, we excel forward together. Where a child can have the opportunity to work and play, instead of suffer and decay. 

What if it wasn’t so difficult. To improve yourself.. to nurture a life.. to start a family. What if it wasn’t so difficult. To combat feelings of self-worth.. to look towards society for love.. to trust others without the feeling of animosity. 

I dream of a world where things are more sentimental. Where the seriousness of the world is not placed within the hands of guns, but within the hands of understanding and compassion. 

This is a topic that’s difficult for me to express, as the world within my mind seems so possible, yet impossible for the foreseeable future. 

A world where we help others, before ourselves..
A world where we think of consequences, before actions..
A world where we love, before judge.. 
A world where we are given opportunity, before we are grown..

I dream of a place where we can be at peace without the fear that exists within our hearts. 

I dream of a world that will not exist within my life, and within that thought resonates sadness within me. I fear that one day that sadness will turn to bitterness and as others before me, become a shell. 

Spread love and keep smiling.
