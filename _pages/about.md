Hey. My name is Marko. This is a blog that I've decided to create to express my life and opinions. From April 2019 - May 2020, I went to Japan on a Working Holiday Visa. While there I experienced so many different things. I went to a place called Nara to visit deer really up close! It was magical. I felt like a disney princess. The main purpose of this blog is to spread awareness of the problem that is littering. In Japan, there are many individuals not employed by their city picking up garbage around their communities. I'd love to bring this culture to Canada.

The reason that I even ended up in Japan is due to this lovely lady here. She visited Canada on a Working Holiday Visa in 2018 and we met around October - and the story began. I followed her back to Japan on a Working Holiday visa and we explored all over the country. We're very much in love and I couldn't ask for a better partner. She's my everything.

The critera for this website are really straight forward. I'm going to be going around the communities of Ontario and picking up garbage, while spreading the name Kito Soji. I'd like to change the publics perception on litter while doing so. 

1. Post content influencing people to mold their bad habits into good ones. 
2. Spread positivity through forward thinking and love. 
3. Change the world by changing our communities into a more team-oriented mindset.
