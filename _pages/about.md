Hey. My name is Marko. This is a blog that I've decided to create to express my life. I went to Japan on a Working Holiday from April 2019 - May 2020. While there, I experienced many different things. I went to a place called Nara to visit deer.. really up close! It was magical. I felt like a disney princess! This blog will be used to spread awareness on the problem that is littering. In Japan, there are many individuals (which are not employed by their city) picking up garbage around their communities. I'd love to bring this culture to Canada.

The reason that I ended up in Japan is due to this lovely lady here. She visited Canada on a Working Holiday in 2018. We met around October of that year and.. the story began. I followed her back to Japan on a Working Holiday Visa and we explored all over the country. This time holds memories I will never forget.

The critera for this website is really straight forward. I'll be going around the communities of Ontario and picking up litter, while spreading the name Kito Soji. I'd like to change the idea of littering while doing so. 

1. Change bad habits to good ones. 
2. Spread positivity through forward thinking and love. 
3. Change the world by changing our communities.
