Hey. My name is Marko. This is a blog that I've decided to create to express my life and opinions. Last year from April 2019 - May 2020, I went to Japan on a Working Holiday Visa.

1. Host is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best for.
2. The entire platform can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's very powerful, but does require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.
3. For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device.
